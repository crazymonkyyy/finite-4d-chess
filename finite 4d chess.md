I love 5d chess. But its unplayable by mere mortals, the rules should not be so literal and there was not a timely response to the queen being bullshit(see the princess vairent) and the kings fragility when it could've had a playerbase(in high level play there was a move to trade you queen to force a king to move out behind the pawns, THAT WAS UNRECOVERABLE). And honestly infinite dementions do not make sense to me(a castle that can travel back in time on turn 20 can travel back to turn 1 in some situations, I feel allowing more then 8 time travel dementions to be absurd)

So finite 4d chess, I think a game of 4d chess where theres 2d grid of 2d grids and specif sizes and limits on the number of boards that exist, I think 8x8x5x5 so theres only 25x more pieces and space then your standard chess at most, this would be a DRASTIC reduction of complexity over the rules of standard 5d chess.

Oh and drop the "kings are checkmated not captured" rule; like its a political rule about real life kings not being killed cause god said so or whatever shit, it makes it harder to teach chess, and most people can not visualise in 4d as is. 2d fine a child can handle it. There are chess grand masters when playing 5d chess couldn't handle it.

So is a list of rules for monkyyys finite 4d chess:

1. there are 5 by 5, time and parrell universes, boards. 2 of these parallel universes are "owned" by each player.
2. Kings are captured, can not time travel, universe travel or duplicate or cease to exist for any time/space reason, except as a new parallel universe being created the first time.
2a. this should mean 5 kings per player.. maybe sorta probaly
3. Victory is when you capture 3 kings at any point, cross time and space
4. Queens are weakened to castle+bishop not 4d set theory thingy
5. pawns cant time or universe travel (for now)
6. "moving" creates a copy of the board a 1/2 turn in the future, with whatever action you took
6a. Simple 2d movement makes a copy of the board 1/2 turn into the future with the board state understood by standard chess rules, the original board is now inactive
6b. moving into an inactive past, creates a copy of that inactive board in an inactive parallel universe you own, if you do not own a inactive parallel universe, this is invalid. AND creates a board 1/2 turn into the future with you piece you moved missing.
6c. moving a piece into an active timeline moves both timeline involved up 1/2 a turn.
7. moves are made one at a time rather then the idea in 5d chess(if thats a good idea? maybe its that way for a reason, but idk it seemed complex)
7a. you cant move a timeline to far into the future of the futherest past?
7b. the global space time is moved forward when it feels right? until such time the rule for that can be clarified; idk averages? Deleting old board states from existence, and creating room for new moves
7c. time slices are owned in 1/2 chunks and with parity, if the white player turn was move 1, the black players owns the time slices 1.5, 2.5, 3.5
8. if there hasn't been a new timeline created by turn 7 by both players making 2d moves, a standard board will be generated using whites timelines.
8a. this is extended in some way that makes sense, like black loses his timeline on turn 14(/8?) or something and so on

But how to play, Im thinking of maybe making a (manual) game of this; cause like you kinda want to make up house rules(given its complex and shit and 4d computer programs are probably hard to make correct anyway, and I have hard criticism for the 5d dev not being active with weakening the queen much faster)
